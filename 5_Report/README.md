# WIPER-CONTROL-SYSTEM
## Abstract
* Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen.The wipers are now available in the front and back window shields the of cars and many other automobiles.A wiper is made up of a metal arm with one end pivoting and the other end having a long rubber blade attached.The blade is swung back and forth across the glass, removing any water, any precipitation, or other obstructions to view.Nowadays the wiper speed is changeable and also we can give some delay for swung the blade so that it will automatically swung after a period of time.In this project i explain about the wiper control system by using the led,stm32 and arm based microcontroller.

## COMPONENTS
* STM32
* ARM based microcontroller

## PROCEDURE
* For the ignition of key position the Red LED is ON, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs
* On press of the user input, Blue, Green and Orange LEDs come ON one at a time with the set frequency, The frequency changes on every alternate key press, 3 frequency levels with 1, 4 and 8 Hz
* The LED glow pattern stops on the 4th press; the wiper action starts next press onwards as mentioned in step 2
* The Red LED is OFF, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs

## Testing and Coding
* Preferable Coding Software for Avr Coding is Microchip studio.
* You have to use C compiler with MINGGW(latest or the previous versions).
* Set path for MINGGW in Environment variables.
* To go with best compiler use CODE BLOCKS.
* In CODE BLOCKS you can also RUN the program in both LINUX and WINDOWS.

## ADVANTAGES
* It helps in saving money by switching off the irrigation system when it rains. This saves money by cutting off bills on electricity consumption.
* It extends life of rain sensor based systems such as car wiper, irrigation systems by running them only when it is necessary.
## DISADVANTAGES
* Smart Wiper Control System uses infrared sensor which is implemented in the latest cars but it has few disadvantages.
* The One is space occupied on the screen is small and the second (main) drawback is need of clear wiping on the windscreen, where the sensor is place

## CONCLUSION
* Wiper system is controlled by using STM32 and ARM based microcontroller.

## REFERENCE
* Referred push button to control the LED's of STM32.
* Surefed in internet regarding CODING.
